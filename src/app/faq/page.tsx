        question: "What products does Green Energy Solutions offer?",
        answer: "We offer a comprehensive range of renewable energy products including inverters, UPS systems, batteries, solar panels, solar water heaters, and related accessories from top brands like Luminous, Exide, Microtek, and more."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide installation services?", 
        answer: "Yes, we provide professional installation services for all our products. Our certified technicians ensure proper installation and setup according to manufacturer guidelines and safety standards."
      },
      {
        question: "What areas do you serve?",
        answer: "We serve customers across India with delivery to 200+ cities. Our service network covers all major metros and tier-1 cities with expanding coverage in smaller towns."
      },
      {
        question: "How can I track my order?",
        answer: "You can track your order using the order number and email address on our Track Order page, or through the tracking link sent via SMS and email after shipment."
      }
    ],
    inverters: [
      {
        question: "What size inverter do I need for my home?",
        answer: "The inverter size depends on your power requirements. For basic lighting and fans (3-4 rooms), a 600VA-850VA inverter works. For running appliances like refrigerator and TV, consider 1.5KVA-3KVA. Our experts can help you calculate the exact requirement."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between Pure Sine Wave and Modified Sine Wave inverters?",
        answer: "Pure Sine Wave inverters produce clean power similar to grid electricity, suitable for sensitive electronics. Modified Sine Wave inverters are cost-effective but may cause humming in some appliances. We recommend Pure Sine Wave for better appliance compatibility."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do inverters typically last?",
        answer: "Quality inverters typically last 8-15 years with proper maintenance. Factors affecting lifespan include usage patterns, environmental conditions, and maintenance frequency. Regular servicing can extend inverter life significantly."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use my inverter during power cuts and grid power simultaneously?",
        answer: "Yes, modern inverters have automatic changeover functionality. They switch to battery mode during power cuts and automatically revert to mains power when electricity returns, ensuring uninterrupted power supply."
      }
    ],
    batteries: [
      {
        question: "How do I choose the right battery for my inverter?",
        answer: "Battery capacity should match your backup time requirements. Calculate total watt-hours needed and divide by battery voltage. For example, if you need 1000Wh backup with a 12V system, you need at least 83Ah battery capacity. Consider 20-30% extra for efficiency losses."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between Tubular and Flat Plate batteries?",
        answer: "Tubular batteries offer longer life (4-6 years), better deep discharge capability, and higher efficiency but cost more. Flat plate batteries are economical with 2-3 years life. For frequent power cuts, tubular batteries are recommended."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I maintain my inverter battery?",
        answer: "Check battery water levels monthly (for maintainable batteries), clean terminals every 3 months, and ensure proper ventilation. Fully charge/discharge the battery monthly to maintain health. Professional servicing every 6 months is recommended."
      },
      {
        question: "Why is my battery backup time reducing?",
        answer: "Common reasons include battery aging, loose connections, overloading, improper charging, or water level issues. Check connections, reduce load, maintain water levels, and consider battery replacement if it's over 3-4 years old."
      }
    ],
    solar: [
      {
        question: "How much can I save with solar installation?",
        answer: "Solar installations typically reduce electricity bills by 70-90%. A 3KW system can save â‚¹15,000-25,000 annually depending on your location and usage patterns. Complete payback typically occurs within 4-6 years."
      },
      {
        question: "What size solar system do I need for my home?",
        answer: "System size depends on your monthly electricity consumption. As a rule of thumb, 1KW solar generates 4-5 units daily. Check your electricity bill for monthly consumption and divide by 120-150 to get approximate KW requirement."
      },
      {
        question: "Do solar panels work during monsoons and cloudy days?",
        answer: "Solar panels work in cloudy conditions but with reduced efficiency (10-25% of normal output). During heavy rain, output drops significantly. However, annual generation remains profitable due to excellent performance in sunny months."
      },
      {
        question: "What maintenance do solar panels require?",
        answer: "Solar panels require minimal maintenance - mainly cleaning dust and debris monthly, checking for physical damage, ensuring proper connections, and monitoring performance. Professional inspection annually is recommended."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there government subsidies for solar installation?",
        answer: "Yes, the government offers subsidies up to 40% for residential solar installations under PM-KUSUM and other schemes. Additional benefits include accelerated depreciation for businesses and net metering policies for excess power sale."
      }
    ],
    service: [
      {
        question: "Do you provide installation services?",
        answer: "Yes, we provide complete installation services through our certified technician network. Installation includes site survey, system design, professional installation, testing, and commissioning with proper documentation."
      },
      {
        question: "What is included in your AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract)?",
        answer: "Our AMC includes preventive maintenance visits, cleaning, testing, minor repairs, replacement of small components, performance monitoring, and priority support. Different AMC plans available based on system type and requirements."
      },
      {
        question: "How quickly can you provide service support?",
        answer: "We provide same-day response for emergency issues in major cities, and within 24-48 hours in other areas. Routine maintenance is scheduled based on your convenience within a week of request."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you service products bought from other dealers?",
        answer: "Yes, we service all major brands regardless of purchase source. Service charges apply for out-of-warranty products. We maintain inventory of common spare parts for faster resolution."
